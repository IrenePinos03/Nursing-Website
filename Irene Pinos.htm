<br>
<br>
<p><i><b>INTRODUCTION</b></i></p>
<br>
	<p>As the saying goes, "Prevention is better than cure," we all want our children to have a better future and a safe environment. We want them to live their lives at their best. That's why our government implemented immunization, especially for our children, to get rid of or avoid many preventable diseases. To some, it may be a choice, but now it is required to have our children immunized for their sake and for the better future of our respective countries.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i><b>What is Immunization?</b></i></p>
<br>
	<p style=text-align:left;">According to PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) "Immunization is the process whereby a person is made resistant to a disease, typically by the administration of a vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to protect the person against indefinite infection or disease."</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i><b>Why is it Important?</b></i></p>
<br>
	<p>This is because immunization protects against diseases, impairments, and fatalities from Vaccine-preventable Diseases (VPDs) theses are:</p>
<br>	
	<p><b>• Bacterial Pneumonias</b></p>
	<p><b>• Rotavirus</b></p>
	<p><b>• Diarrheal illnesses</b></p>
	<p><b>• Bacterial meningitis</b></p>
	<p><b>• Poliomyelitis</b></p>
	<p><b>• Measles, Mumps and Rubella</b></p>
	<p><b>• Diphtheria</b></p>
	<p><b>• Tetanus</b></p>
	<p><b>• Pertussis</b></p>
	<p><b>• Hepatitis A and B</b></p>
	<p><b>• Haemaphilus Influenzae Type B</b></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><i><b>Immunization in the Philippines</b></i></p>
<br>
	<p style=text-align:left;">According to the Department of Health (DOH) The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) was established in 1976 to ensure that infants/children and mothers have access to routinely recommended infant/childhood vaccines. The Vaccines under the EPI are BCG birth dose, Hepatitis B birth dose, Oral Poliovirus Vaccine, Pentavalent Vaccine, Measles Containing Vaccines (Anti-measles Vaccine, Measles, Mumps, Rubella) and Tetanus Toxoid. In 2014, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 13 was included in the routine immunization of EPI. Later in 2016, the EPI will become the National Immunization Program (NIP), where it will include immunizations of other populations, such as senior citizen immunizations, school-age immunizations, and adolescent immunizations.</p>
<br>	
	<p style=text-align:left;">The NIP aims to immunize 95% of children in the Philippines to the fullest extent possible. According to Maria Rosario Vergeire, the officer-in-charge of the Department of Health (DOH), the indefinable lower percentage result for 2022 is 62.9%.</p>
